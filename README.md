# vuejs_exercises

In each folder with name "PXX" where XX is the number of the exercise are the files App, components (if it's the case) and main.
In order to be executed you should have an environment where vue.js code can be executed.

This are just exercises we did at a school subject to practice JavaScript and Vue.js as a front-end framework.
